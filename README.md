This is a e-commerce project built using MERN Stack technology that allows over a thousand users to register, login, select desired number of available goods in stock and either add to cart to purchase later or make immediate payment using paystack payment method awaiting delivery.
Implemented JSON Web token authorization for security and added restricted middleware to prevent access to unauthorized endpoints.
Bootstrap and Material UI were implemented for design to improve user experience and to categories over 100 goods by types with their respective prices.
Tested all the endpoints on postman and made sure the worked properly before deploying the API.
